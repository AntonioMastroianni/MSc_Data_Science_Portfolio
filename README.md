## üìö List of Projects

- [‚öΩ The Magic Formula to Score Goals](https://github.com/AntonioMastroianni/Machine-Learning-Exam)  
 Machine Learning exam on football event data using association analysis and logistic regression in order to determine the best sequence of events that lead do scoring a goal.

- [üé• Merge and analysis movie data from IMDb and TMDB](https://github.com/AntonioMastroianni/Data-Management-Project)  
 Data Management exam on movie data, eploring DBMS and techniques.

- [üåé An alternative intervention approach for solving nutrition deprivation in Belize](https://github.com/AntonioMastroianni/Data-Science-Lab-Project)  
 An analytical approach to tackling nutrition deprivation in Belize using housing conditions as a proxy for localized intervention planning.

- [ü§ñ Exploring Translation Models: A Comparative Study of Seq2Seq and LLM Architectures for English-Italian Machine Translation](https://github.com/Pakyy/NLP-Project---MT-en-it/tree/main)  
 A study comparing different neural network architectures for English-Italian machine translation. The primary goal of the project is to evaluate the performance of Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models and Large Language Models (LLMs) under various training paradigms.

- [üèôÔ∏è Comparative Analysis of Open Data Ecosystems: A Case Study of the London DataStore and Comune di Milano](https://github.com/AntonioMastroianni/Smart-Cities-Project/tree/main)  
 Comparative analysis of the open data ecosystems of the London DataStore and the Comune di Milano Open Data Portal. Their development, adherence to open data principles, and practical utility for urban decision-making are evaluated.

- [üõ∞Ô∏è MSc Thesis; Predicting Census Area Typologies Using Deep Learning solutions:](https://github.com/AntonioMastroianni/MSc-Thesis)  
 This research introduces a new method for validating and classifying ISTAT census areas. It combines geospatial data validation using the Google Maps Places API with deep learning techniques that utilize satellite imagery, enhanced by GPT-4o-assisted re-labeling. The 
 approach aims to address the issue of outdated land-use classifications and has potential applications in real estate, urban planning, and geographic analysis.
